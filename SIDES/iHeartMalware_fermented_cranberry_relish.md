# iHeartMalwares Fermented Cranberry Sauce

I made this one year for Thanksgiving, and everyone who had it went
nuts. So much so that I had "orders" the following year. (16+ quarts of
orders, to be exact) The great thing with this is that it's fermented,
so it will last a good while in the fridge. This is amazing with cream
cheese on a bagel, over cream cheese with crackers, or served over some
goat cheese with crackers. I do this in 2 gallon batches, so scale
accordingly.

## Ingredients

-   18 Cups cranberries, whole
-   6 large oranges
-   3 Cups walnuts
-   3 Cups honey
-   2 Cups white grape juice
-   2 Cups red grape juice
-   2 tbsp cinnamon
-   4 tbsp lemon juice
-   2 tbsp salt
-   Fermenting crock

## Instructions

1.  Get a big bowl. A really big bowl.
2.  Slice the oranges, and process them whole in a food processor.
    Process the cranberries and walnuts as well.
3.  If the processor is un-happy, feel free to add the juices and / or
    honey. Add to bowl.
4.  Once processed, pour into the bowl. This will happen in several
    batches.
5.  Add the rest of the ingredients.
6.  Once done, ferment for 2-4 days, or until fermentation starts. I
    like to use these kimchi fermenters, as it limits the chances of
    mold:

7.  Once started, toss it into the fridge to taste. 1-2 weeks is usually
    the magic time, then it can be removed from the fermenting vessel
    and added to containers. Fermented foods taste better with age, and
    we've eaten this 3 months after making the original batch.

NOTE: Make sure you are comfortable with fermenting before doing this.
Do your homework on fermenting and do it safely! Mold == bad.
