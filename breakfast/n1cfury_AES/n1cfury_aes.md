#n1cfury's AES (Avocado, Eggs, Sriracha)


Being on a tight budget in between jobs and wanting to get in the habit of eating breakfast I wanted to come up with an easy and filling breakfast.  This meal takes minimal effort and will keep you satisfied until lunch.

##Resources

A [small cast-iron skillet](https://www.amazon.com/Lodge-L3SK3-Skillet-Pre-Seasoned-6-5-inch/dp/B00063RWT8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1487463235&sr=8-1&keywords=small+cast+iron+skillet)

##Ingredients

2 eggs
1 ripe Avocado
Sriracha
[Olive oil](http://www.humbleoliveoils.com/infused/garlic-olive-oil) - I use Humble Olive Oils
Sea Salt
Black Pepper

##Preparation

If you have refrigerated the Avocado, make sure you take it out the night before.  It's not a deal breaker, but it will work better if its already at room temperature.  Before you start cooking, slice the Avocado in half the long way and 'unscrew' it maintaining the half with the pit.  Inside the half without the pit, dice it up in the skin so it is easier to spread.  Unless you're really hungry, save the half with the pit for later and put it in the fridge.  YES, LEAVE THE SEED INSIDE.  Trust me.

##Instructions

Turn on the stove at low heat.  If you have a gas stove, the flame should be barely visible.  Put a few drops of olive oil on the skillet to coat the bottom and run it along the inside taking account for the surface area of the egg.  Once it warms up, add a small amount of the sea salt and pepper to the skillet, enough to where the pepper will slightly sizzle.  After this crack open two eggs and pour into the skillet adding a bit more salt and pepper to the top of the egg.

At low heat you should start to notice the bottom cook and become solid.  Take a fork and scoop at the edges ensuring you can scrape it off, but dont remove it yet.   Once the egg can be flipped without spilling, flip it over and let it cook.  While its cooking, evenly spread the half of Avocado onto the egg.  Turn off the stove and wait about a minute.  Remove from the skillet and place onto a plate and add Sriracha on top of the Avocado.  I usually do a spiral pattern or tic-tac-toe to cover it evenly without overdoing it.

I did this without toast because its not as messy and less carbs if you care about that sort of thing.  Enjoy!
