#@hardwaterhacker's Grilled Cedar Plank Salmon


This recipe works great for any salmonid.  I've used it on Alaskan red salmon, lake trout, chinook and coho salmon, but should work well with other trout or salmon species.

Serves: 3-4

##Ingredients

(1) 2 lb. (900 g) salmon fillet, skin left on<br>
1/2 c (90 g) brown sugar, packed<br>
2 Tbsp (30 mL) extra virgin olive oil<br>
1 Tbsp (6.8 g) dried italian seasoning mix (basil, marjoram, organo, parsley, rosemary, thyme)<br>
1 Tsp (2.3 g) smoked paprika<br>
1/2 tsp (3 g) kosher salt<br>
Fresh ground black pepper<br>
(2) lemons<br>
(1) Cedar plank

##Preparation

Soak cedar plank in water for at least one hour prior to grilling.

Preheat gas grill to medium.

Slice lemons with rind on as thinly as possible.

1. Cover cedar plank with lemon slices.
2. Place fillet on plank on top of lemon slices.
3. Season fillet with black pepper.
4. Combine brown sugar, italian seasoning, paprika, and kosher salt in a mixing bowl.  Add olive oil and mix until mixture is like a paste.
5. Spread brown sugar mixture over fillet.  Ensure fillet is fully covered.  Try to cover exposed end of fillet.
6. Grill fillet for 25 minutes or until thickest part of fillet reaches 135 degrees F (57 C) internal temperature.

Keep a close eye on the grill during cooking.  The brown sugar mixture is likely to flare up.   Knock down flames with a spray bottle filled with water.
