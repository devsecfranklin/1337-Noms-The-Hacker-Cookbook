Depending on baking dish size it is usually easier to double the recipe.
Use this as protien replacement in dish where flavor profile fits or
have as snacks.

Notes
-----

-  you can get away with 2 hours of marinating but longer can be better
   if time permits. I have personally not been able to differentiate
   between like 6 and 12 hours. I usually prep this in morning and put
   it in fridge.
-  might want make sure the dish is at roomish temperature before
   putting in oven.
-  clean dish sooner than later

Quick prep and only oven time for cooking. For a quick meal add some
quinoa or wild rice with a vegetable of choice.
