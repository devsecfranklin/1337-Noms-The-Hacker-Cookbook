Ajn’s Point Reyes Brussel Sprout Salad
======================================

The key is absolutely the mild flavor of this cheese from a creamery in
Calfornia. Been meaning to try cambazola for fun, but haven’t yet had
the chance. Here goes…

Ingredients
-----------

-  1/3-1/2lb uncooked, untrimmed Brussels sprouts
-  1 tbsp+ high quality olive oil
-  1 tbsp maple syrup
-  1 tbsp grainy mustard
-  2-3ish oz Point Reyes blue cheese, room temp
-  1/2 Bosc pear, sliced thin and halved
-  Handful of lightly candied walnuts (optional)
-  Salt & pepper
-  1 Tbsp of Apple Cider Vinegar

Instructions
------------

1. Insert a fork into the stem end of each sprout, and shred on a
   mandolin slicer moving in a single direction until only the portion
   you would have trimmed is left. Consistency is key here; you want
   light, shredded bits with some thinly sliced core pieces
2. In a large bowl, mix oil, syrup, mustard and blue cheese with a fork,
   mashing the cheese until smooth and integrated. You could use a food
   processor, but I find this easier. Balance cheese/oil/mustard to your
   preference, along with light salt/pepper.
3. Mix in sprouts until you achieve a dressing:sprout ratio you like. We
   prefer it pretty thin on dressing. Add pears and sprinkle with
   walnuts. Serve with grilled beef/pork/lamb.
