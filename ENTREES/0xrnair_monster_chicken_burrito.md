# Monster Chicken Burrito (Extra Hot)

A quick way to get a large meal ready with the least amount of effort.

## Ingredients

-   1/2 Can Pinto Beans/ Black Beans
-   1 Boneless Chicken Breast
-   3 Tablespoon Sriracha Sauce
-   1 Avocado (Per your prefernce More = Juicy )
-   Couple of Flakes of Scorpion Pepper (Spice it up) *Optional*
-   Vinegar (White)
-   3/4 Tablespoon salt
-   Old Bay seasoning
-   1 tsp Red Chilli Powder (Optional)
-   1/2 Lemon
-   1 Large (very) Tortilla

## Preparation

The preparation is pretty straightforward. Wash/Drain your chicken then
add in salt, generous amounts of Oldbay seasoning (2 fistful) , red
chilli powder and mix them well. Then add in half lemon and a 4
tablespoons of white vinegar. Keep it overnight. *Poking some holes into
the chicken helps too*

## Instructions

1.  Season with Pepper heavily and then microwave the chicken breast for
    8-11 minutes (Depending on the power of your microwave), most large
    microwaves cook it around 8.45 minutes; also let it rest for 4
    minutes in the microwave. Use a spoon and blast the chicken to thin
    shreds.
2.  Get the tortilla heated and then plaster half the avocado as the
    base, Add in the chicken shreds, 4 tablespoon of beans, 3 tablespoon
    sriracha sauce, flakes, remaining avocado and wrap it (the hard
    part).

Have fun stuffing yourself.

In case stuffing all the ingredients into a single tortilla seems too
much for you, you can split the above into 2 burritos but will lose the
"monster" tag.
