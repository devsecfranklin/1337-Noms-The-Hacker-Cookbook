Ingredients
-----------

-  Leftover chicken parm
-  Shredded Cheese of your choice, one handful per layer
-  Tortilla chips, half a handful per layer
-  (optional) Various ‘fun enhancers’ including but not limited to:

   -  Ground Beef, three pinches per layer
   -  Sliced Olives, one pinch per layer
   -  Diced Bell Pepper, two pinches per layer
   -  Salsa, three teaspoons per layer

Instructions
------------

1. Arrange your chips on top of the chicken parm so that it is
   completely covered
2. Sprinkle your shredded cheese over the tortilla chips so that there’s
   an even distribution
3. Sprinkle your fun enhancers on the cheese (if any)
4. Microwave until the cheese is melted to your satisfaction

Tips n Tricks
-------------

-  This snack is best prepared and served between 23:00 and 04:00 during
   an all nighter when you’re getting hungry and want to take a short
   relaxing break.
-  Don’t be afraid of being too boring if you don’t have some fun
   enhancers. Simply heating up your chicken parm and eating it plain
   would be boring. We’re making nachos!
-  After you’ve finished your nachos just pick up the chicken parm and
   eat it with your hands.
