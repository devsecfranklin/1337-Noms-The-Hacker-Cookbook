# Boredsilly's Baked Gringo

Why is it called a Baked Gringo? It's full of white cheese, mild chilies, and is 420 friendly (quick, fattening, and gloriously cheesy). Also, it can't dance, play sports, or survive a day in prison. This is a family favorite for comfort food. Provided by @boredsilly

## Ingredients

- 20 to 24 slices of thinly sliced smoked ham 
- 2 pounds of Monterrey Jack (block form)
- 3 small cans of whole green chilies (or fresh roasted and peeled Anaheim chilies) 
- 1 package of small flour tortillas (10 to 12 count)
- 3 cups of finely shredded cheddar cheese (sharp or mild)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit
2. Cut the cheese blocks into 1/2 to 3/4 inch rectangular slices
3. Open and slice the whole green chiles length wise into 1 to 2 inch wide
4. Take two slices of ham and roll/fold them up so they're only a few inches across and lay them down the center of a tortilla
5. Place a straight line of chilies along the center on top of the ham
6. Top the ham and chilies with one or more slabs of the white cheese
7. Roll the tortilla up into a tube like an enchilada with the ends OPEN (not folded closed like a burrito)
8. Place the tortilla in a baking pan upside down with the rolled flaps on the bottom so it stays closed (you can add a toothpick to help keep it closed while filling the pan but I remove them before cooking)
9. Repeat the process until the whole pan is filled with rolled tortilla happiness
10. Evenly spread the shredded cheddar cheese across the top
11. Place the baking pan in the center rack of your oven until the cheese is melted and your desired level of crispiness is achieved. (Usually 25 to 35 minutes)
12. Let cool for 10-15 minutes before serving
