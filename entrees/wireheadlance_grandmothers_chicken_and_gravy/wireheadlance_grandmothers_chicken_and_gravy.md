# wireheadlance's "Little Grandma's Famous Fried Chicken and Gravy"

This is a recipe from wireheadlance's grandmother for fried chicken and gravy!

## Instructions

1. “Select whatever parts you want & salt & pepper. Have about 1/2 inch of oil in frying pan & hot (she always used her electric skillet).
2. Roll chicken in flower & place skin-side down in hot fat.
3. Don’t cook too fast (med hot) & cook till nice & brown & then turn over. Takes about 30-45 minutes., depends on the size of the fryer. If it’s a larger one, it takes longer. (Watch, it can burn easily).
4. When all is done & you want gravy, drain most of the fat off, leaving about 1/4 c in the pan (save the crunches!) & add 1 T flour & about 1 1/2 C milk & salt & pepper. 
5. Cook till beginning to thicken - not too think now, as it sets it thickens some. This gravy is also made at last minute before serving”

## Author Notes
Mother always cut up her down chickens - she liked the boney pieces like the ribs & back * you couldn’t get them already cut that way. She would rinse the chicken & pieces soak them in a bowl of cold water with lots of salt in it. Then she’d pat them dry & salt & pepper them. Next, Mom would shake the pieces in a bag of flour (sometimes she’d put salt, pepper, & paprika in it, maybe a little poultry seasoning or Lawry’s seasoned salt instead).
Mother usually fried her chicken in her electric skillet, set at about 260-275, covered, with it vented just to let a little steam escape. Seems to me that she started it a little higher & then turned down the temp when she turned the pieces over. 

Gravy for pork steaks was made in the same manner, except she let the drippings & the flour brown in the grease until it looked like it was starting to scorch & then added the milk…that gave it a nice, rich brown color.
