This is a collaborative effort. The goal is to collect recipes for an
eclectic mix of dishes from around the hacker community. Tell us about
your favorite recipe or something you like to make with your own unique
twist. Feel free to include a recommendation for booze pairing.

General questions should be directed to
\[\@mzbat\](<https://twitter.com/mzbat>) or
\[\@iheartmalware\](<https://twitter.com/iheartmalware>).

We can't promise that all submissions will be included in the final
printed book. We do plan to leave this repo up indefinitely. We intend
to give proceeds from any sales of printed book to [Electronic Frontier
Foundation](https://supporters.eff.org/shop).
