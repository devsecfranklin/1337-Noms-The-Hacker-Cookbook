# Street Corn @theDevilsVoice

A fairly healthy vegetable dish. Spicy, and a nice complement to your 
Mexican food on Taco Tuesday.

## Ingredients

- 3  or 4 cans of corn
- 1 bunch cilantro, larger stems removed, and roughly chopped 
- 2 tsp. lime juice
- 10 oz. Feta Cheese (approximate)
- 2 Tbsp. Mayonaise
- 2 Tbsp. sour cream

## Optional

- Tortilla Chips
- Serrano Chiles, diced


## Instructions

1. In a large skillet or wok, heat up about 1/3 cup of olive oil. 
2. heat the corn in the hot oil until it starts to turn brown, stirring occasionaly so it doesn't stick.
3. Dump the corn into a bowl with the rest of the ingredients and stir. 
4. Eat it with chips like a dip or put it on your tacos. Optionally spice it up with Serrano or other chile & spices.
