Deviant Ollam’s Sous Vide Steak
===============================

a simple set of details, but created after loads of testing and tweaking
over time, often in hotel rooms. see also “The Hotel Room Gourmet” here…

Supplies
--------

-  Sous vide immersion circulator (the Anova and the Joule are my two
   favorites)
-  Heavy duty zip-loc bags (freezer bag thickness)
-  Searzall or cast iron over hot stove

Ingredients
-----------

-  Ribeye steaks (ideally ribeye cap, ideally USDA prime)
-  Large grain french grey sea salt
-  Cracked and ground black pepper
-  Bay leaves
-  Liquid aminos
-  Butter from grass-fed cows
-  High smoke point oil such as avocado oil or extra light olive oil
   (optional)

Instructions
------------

1.  Bring your water bath up to 126.5 degrees Fahrenheit (52.5 decrees
    Celsius).
2.  Remove steak from butcher’s packaging and, while still cold, apply
    heat (either Searzall or via stove top cast iron with high smoke
    point oil) to sear all sides (this is known as the “pre-sear”
    method).
3.  Place pre-seared (but still uncooked) steak into heavy duty ziploc
    bag, along with a pinch of french grey sea salt, one pinch of
    cracked black pepper, one pinch of ground black pepper, two bay
    leaves, and three squirts of liquid aminos. (optional: a small
    drizzle of your oil can go in the bag, mostly to help with heat
    transfer and eliminating air pockets).
4.  Use the “sous vide water immersion technique” to remove air from the
    bag… slowly lower the bagged food into your water bath, letting the
    pressure of the water force the air out through the top of the bag.
    once the air is out of the bag, carefully seal it just above the
    water line.
5.  The temperature of your water bath may drop slightly as the cold
    meat bag is exposed to the water, but allow the immersion circulator
    to bring the water bath back up to temperature. once the target
    temperature is reached, keep the bag in the bath for a duration
    calculated as “30 minutes for each finger of thickness of steak” …
    that is to say, if you have a three-finger steak, you’d keep it
    rolling in the sous vide bath for 90 minutes. (NOTE: these times are
    just a minimum. it is entirely safe to keep a sous vide cook process
    running for hours or even days as long as the temperature is above
    122 degrees Fahrenheit (50 decrees Celsius).
6.  After your minimum cook time has been achieved, you are free to
    remove the steak whenever it is time to serve. remove the bag from
    the sous vide bath and open it over a sink or other receptacle as
    you use tongs to remove your now-cooked steak. take care to not
    bring any large peppercorns or bay leaves with the steak. (NOTE: if
    you cooked for more than six hours, there is a chance that much of
    the steak has broken down and is extra tender… take caution that it
    doesn’t fall apart… use quality tongs).
7.  Bonus pro step: place whatever dishes will be used for serving and
    dining into the still-hot water bath to allow them to warm up while
    you finish the steak execution.
8.  Pat the steak dry slightly as you prepare to again use the hot cast
    iron or to use the Searzall. sprinkle a pinch of ground black pepper
    and french grey sea salt on all sides and rub it in slightly.
9.  Sear all sides of the steak again. A nice, solid sear.
10. Plate the steak on your now-warm dishware. Rest a generous pat of
    the grass-fed cow butter atop and let it begin to melt. serve
    quickly, so that the already-limited heat in the steak does not
    dissipate too much. suggested sides: asparagus, broad beans, mashed
    cauliflower, or mushrooms sautéed in butter. enjoy!
