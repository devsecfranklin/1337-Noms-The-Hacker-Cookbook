TailPufft’s Cream Cheese Roll Out Cookies with Orange
=====================================================

Cookies
-------

-  1 cup butter - close to room tempterature
-  1 8 pz. package of cream cheese - room temperature
-  2 cups granulated sugar
-  2 eggs
-  4 tsp. frozen orange juice concentrate
-  Zest of 1 orange
-  1 tsp. vanilla extract
-  1 tsp. almond extract
-  2 tsp. baking powder
-  5 cups flour
-  Extra flour for dusting

Icing Recipe
------------

-  1 cup powdered sugar
-  1 tbsp. milk
-  1 tbsp. light corn syrup
-  1 drop lemon juice

Directions
----------

A. Pre-heat oven to 350 1. Cream together butter and sugar. Don’t rush
the creaming together of the butter and sugar step, otherwise the pastry
gods will find you and they will punish you. Whisk in cream cheese.
Whisk in eggs. Add all the other wet stuff. Add in the orange zest too.
You now have a bucket o’ orange smelling buttery wet stuff 2. Mix all
the dry stuff seperately. 3. Slowly incorporate the dry mixture into the
wet mixture. Go ahead and curse a bit for not doing this in a larger
sized bowl and go find a larger bowl. I’ll wait. B. Do not do this in
your Kitchenaid mixer as 5 cups of flour is too much for it and I will
not bring you Kleenex for your tears when you fry your Kitchenaid motor.
(at most, mix up to 3 cups of flour in the wet mixture using the paddle
kitchenaid attachment, but then mix the last two cups of flour in by
hand.) 4. Take this lovely smelling rather firm lump of dough, divide it
into two squirrel sized lumps and chill. 5. After about 20-30 minutes,
take out chilly dough squirrel number 1 and dust the counter with flour.
Roll out the dough to about 1 fat centimeter of thickness. Use lots of
sprinkles of flour to keep the dough from sticking to your rolling pin
and / or the counter. This dough gets stickier the warmer it gets, so
try to keep it nice and cold, like my heart. 6. Go nuts with the cookie
cutters. Don’t let anyone give you any crap for owning too many cookie
cutters. This recipe holds shapes well throughout baking. C. This will
make more cookies than you have patience to clean up after. This will
make more cookies than your children will have the attention span to
decorate. D. If you decide to freeze chilly dough squirrel number 2 for
later, have at it. This dough freezes very well.

Baking
------

1. Either grease cookie sheets or use parchment paper. Is the oven on?
   Put the whiskey down and turn the oven on.
2. Keep an eye on these suckers as it is a pretty quick bake. I would
   check them after 8 minutes, but usually take about 10 minutes for a
   variety of sizes. We make little bats for Christmas. Christmas bats
   take about 8 minutes. Very lightely golden at the edges means they
   are done.
3. Enjoy watching various stages of cookies take over every single
   horizontal surface of your house.

Icing
-----

1. Let the cookies cool, as putting icing on hot cookies will cause the
   icing to make a mess.
2. Mix everything together, then put on cookies. Or just dip the cookies
   in the icing.
