# Hashbrownpatty Bacon Sandwich

Play with your food and then eat it!

## Ingredients

-   2x Standard issue Hashbrownpatties
-   A few strips of bacon

## Instructions

-   Place the hashbrownpatties adjacent to one another as if they were
    slices of bread (keep in mind the context : you are about to make a
    sandwich)
-   Tear the strips of bacon into smaller pieces so that if one slice is
    placed lengthwise across a hashbrownpatty there isn't too much
    overflow (hacker discretion is advised only at the advice of a
    hacker)
-   Place your bacon kilobytes (these are much larger than bacon bits)
    on the bottom hashbrownpatty
-   Place the top hashbrownpatty on top of the bacon kilobytes

## Tips n' Tricks

-   Please don't put ketchup on it.
