# The Hacker Cookbook

This is a collaborative effort. The goal is to collect recipes for
an eclectic mix of dishes from around the hacker community. Tell
us about your favorite recipe or something you like to make with
your own unique twist. Feel free to include a recommendation for
booze pairing.

General questions should be directed to [@iheartmalware](https://twitter.com/iheartmalware)

We can't promise that all submissions will be included in the final
printed book. We do plan to leave this repo up indefinitely. We
intend to give any proceeds to a charitable cause.
