## Discussion

As a long time fan of the Old Fashioned, I was sitting in a bar in
Birmingham one day and ordering them by the score while talking to some
friends. One of the bartenders asked me if I had ever heard of a New
Fashioned. To which I replied no, but please procure this wonderful new
beverage for me. After tasting it, I realized I had found a great
complementary drink for lighter non-red meat dishes. I have since made
my own amaretto and use that in this recipe, but it is far from
required..

Making Old and New Fashioned's is fun for an aspiring amateur bartender.
You get to muddle and mix, slice and stir. Something about it
incorporates everything that is good in being a mixologist while still
preserving the basics. I love serving these when people come over, it
lets you talk while still being a show off.

The only difference between this and a traditional Old Fashioned is the
addition of the amaretto. Some people also use 1 tsp of wild flower
honey instead of the sugar cube, but I enjoy proper muddling.
