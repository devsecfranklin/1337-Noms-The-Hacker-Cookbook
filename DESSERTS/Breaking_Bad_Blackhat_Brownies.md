# Breaking Bad BlackHat Brownies

A nice pick-me-up mocha-ish treat. Versatile. I suggest using the
strongest most wicked coffee you can. I use Death Wish Coffee, at twice
the caffeine, but for taste, you may want to use whatever brand you
prefer tastes better.

    salted/unsalted) Also please check and abide by State Laws if adding
    any "alternative" butter.
